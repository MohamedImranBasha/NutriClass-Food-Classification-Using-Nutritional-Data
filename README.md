# NutriClass-Food-Classification-Using-Nutritional-Data




# Problem Statement:
In the era of increasing dietary awareness, the ability to classify food items based on nutritional attributes are invaluable. This project involves developing a machine learning model that classifies food into multiple categories using tabular data such as calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and sugar. By the end of this project,  we will be able to create a robust classification system that can accurately label food types and gain insights into what makes each food category distinct. management systems.

## 🔍 Use Cases:
Smart Dietary Applications: Recommend food based on nutritional balance.
Health Monitoring Tools: Assist nutritionists in classifying food for diet planning.
Food Logging Systems: Automatically classify user entries for food-tracking apps.
Educational Platforms: Help learners understand food categories and nutrition through AI.
Grocery/Meal Planning Apps: Auto-suggest replacements within same category
